****Cypress Automation Project****


This project demonstrates automated testing using Cypress with a focus on the following key features:

1) Page Object Model (POM): Utilized to enhance code maintainability by separating the test logic from the page-specific code.
2) Data-Driven Testing: Implemented to run tests with multiple sets of data, improving test coverage and robustness.
3) Excel Data Integration: Incorporated to read test data from Excel sheets, enabling dynamic and flexible data management.
4) Assertions: Comprehensive assertions are used to validate test outcomes and ensure the application behaves as expected.
   
This project showcases best practices in test automation, making it an excellent reference for those looking to implement similar solutions.
